        Created a new click protopackage

        * A copy of click 3.0-0 (click/Files/3/0) has been
        modified to produce click 7.0-0 (click/Files/7/0).
        * By design, only one function (click) is exposed, so as
        to minimize polution of the search path. Other functions
        intended as part of the interface are accessible by
        using the query arguments of the click function.
        * The file structure has been completely redesigned in
        attempt to optimize for persistence while facilitating
        change.
        * Two ways of building the protopackage are offered,
        corresponding to two differently-behaved click
        functions: one keeps the return-values consistent with
        previous versions, and the second has the same type of
        return-value for both keyboard key and mouse button
        events (a one-row data.frame).
