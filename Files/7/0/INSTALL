Installing the click protopackage

                The click protopackage is not designed to be
                installed in the sense of the install.packages
                of the utils package. Rather, the click
                protopackage is designed to be sourced in the
                sense of the source function in the base
                package.

                To use the click protopackage as designed, copy
                the protopackage to a known location, herein
                called LIB. Then use the following to attach the
                click environment to the search path:

                LIB <- "file-path-to-the-click-protopackage"
                BUILD.R <- "/inst/extdata/R/2/0/build/0/1.R" 
                attach (
                    what = source (
                        paste0 ( LIB , BUILD.R ) ) [[ 1 ]] ( LIB ) ,
                    name = "protoPkg:click" )
