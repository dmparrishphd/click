    ============================================================
help---Usage:
    ------------------------------------------------------------
            # PRECONDITION: One of a few certain graphics
            # devices must correspond with `dev.cur()`.
    ipoint.click <- source ( paste0 ( pathname , "/ipoint.click.R" )
        ) [[ 1 ]] ( pathname )
            # where `pathname` is the pathname where this
            # package is installed.  A successful **call** to
            # ipoint.click requires that at least one graphics
            # device be present.
    ipoint.click(XY, leftClick, env, out = c("i", "leftClick", "env")) 
help---Arguments:
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    XY:
        A two-column numeric matrix. Coordinates for the "x" and
        "y" directions are taken from columns 1 and 2,
        consistent with the primary argument of `points`.
    leftClick:
        One of several functions that capture a left-click. See
        Examples for one way to obtain such a function.
    env:
        One of several environments that support leftClick. See
        Examples for one way to obtain such a function.
    out:
        Specifies the type of return desired: indices of
        near-points ("i"), a function compatible with the
        leftClick argument ("leftClick"), or an environment
        compatible with the env argument ("env").
help---Details:
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    Behavior is device dependent. See the lib/o26230640
    subdirectory for additional information; that subdiretory is
    a copy of o2623064040723351104365234371651414660040072.
