help---Usage:
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    # PRECONDITION: ONE OF A FEW CERTAIN GRAPHICS DEVICES MUST
    # CORRESPOND WITH `dev.cur()`
    metaLeftClick.R <- paste0(pathname, "/metaLeftClick.R")
    # where `pathname` is the pathname where this package is
    # installed.
    metaLeftClick <- source(metaLeftClick.R)[[1]]
    # A successful **call** to metaLeftClick requires that at
    # least one graphics device be present.
    leftClick <- metaLeftClick(pathname)
    leftClick(
        retryMessage = paste0(
            "Oops! Try again:---\n" ,
            "1) click (press and release the primary pointer-",
            "button only) or\n" ,
            "2) press a keyboard-key to cancel.\n" ) ,
        button = list (
            x11cairo = c ( TRUE , TRUE ) ,
            windows = c ( TRUE , FALSE ) ) [[ names ( dev.cur() ) ]] )
help---Arguments:
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    retryMessage:
        A string to write to `stderr()` if a non--left-click
        event is detected.
    button:
        A two-element logical vector indicating whether button
        zero is active during the expected "mouseDown" and
        "mouseUp" events. During testing, it was found that
        `button` should be specified as `c(TRUE, FALSE)` for a
        `windows` device (MS Windows) and `c(TRUE, TRUE)` for an
        `X11cairo` device (Red Hat Linux).
help---Details:
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    Behavior is device dependent.
        If the expected left-click is detected, it is expected
    that the "event", "t", "x", and "y" fields of the return be
    equivalent accross graphics devices which are compatible
    with `leftClick` (e.g., `windows` and `X11`).
        The "key", "b0", "b1", and "b2" fields will depend upon
    the type of graphics device.
help---Examples:
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    # EXAMPLE 1
    # This example has been tested on "windows" and "X11cairo"
    # graphics devices.
    pathname <- "(PATHNAME TO THIS PROTOPACKAGE)"
    #PRECONDITION: no graphics devices present
    stopifnot(identical(dev.list(), NULL))
    # The `metaLeftClick` function may be **sourced**
    # independently of device presence.
    metaLeftClick.filepath <- paste0(pathname, "/metaLeftClick.R")
    metaLeftClick <- source(metaLeftClick.filepath)[[1]]
    # A compatible device must be current before **calling**
    # metaLeftClick.
    # Create two graphics devices
    for ( k in 1 : 2 ) {
        dev.new(xpos = 64*k, ypos = 64*k)
        plot(1, col = NA)
        text(1, 1, labels = dev.cur()) }
    # There are two devices; we make a leftClick function for
    # each one:
    dev.set(dev.list()[[1]])
    leftClickA <- metaLeftClick(pathname)
    dev.set(dev.list()[[2]])
    leftClickB <- metaLeftClick(pathname)
    # Before requesting a left click, we draw a box around the
    # outer margin of the figure on the current device.
    obox <- function (...) box(which = "outer", ...)
    box. <- function () obox(col = "red", lwd = 3)
    whiteOut <- function () obox(col = "white", lwd = 4)
    dev.set(dev.list()[[1]]); box.(); leftClickA(); whiteOut()
    # See note [1], below.
    dev.set(dev.list()[[2]]); box.(); leftClickB(); whiteOut()
    # See note [1], below.
    # Note [1]: A prompt should appear on the console.  The
    # leftClick function is waiting for an event to occur on the
    # current graphics device. You may need to direct focus to
    # the current graphics device (click the title bar).
